# Data is the new Oil

-- Higher Order Components
     - It's a function that takes a component and returns a component.
     - It's a function, that takes a component as an input, enhances it and returns it back.

* Creating the total Ratings label on the restro card which 10k+ ratings.
    
    Higher Order component
    input -- Restaurant Card
    output -- totalRatings > 10k+     

Higher Order Components are pure functions, because we are not changing the input component. we are just enhancing it and returing.

Pure functions or Components are the ones, where we don't change the props or state.

All the react applications have two layers
    1.) UI Layer
    2.) Data Layer

    And this UI layer (consist of JSX) is powered by 
    Data layer (consist of state,props, local variables,{whatever JS we write} )

If the state of the component is handled by it's parent then it's the controlled component.
If the state if managed by the component itself, it's uncontrolled component.
